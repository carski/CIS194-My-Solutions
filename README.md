# CIS194-My-Solutions
UPenn Spring 13 Haskell Course available here https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/

All the course-provided helper files and data are included along with my solutions.

Bear in mind that I cannot verify these solutions are 100% correct, and also that I am first learning Haskell using this course.


Versions used:
* GHC 8.10.7
* MonadRandom 0.5.3 (cabal)
